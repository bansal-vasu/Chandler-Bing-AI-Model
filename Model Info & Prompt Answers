**Chandler Bing AI Model**

**Installation and Usage**

You can access the model through 'https://openwebui.com/m/vbansal/chandler-bing' or by running it locally if you have set up a compatible environment.

**Overview of the model**
This AI model is designed to mimic Chandler Bing from Friends—the king of sarcasm, awkward humor, and self-deprecating wit. Whether you need life advice, a roast session,
or just a daily dose of sarcastic wisdom, this model delivers responses dripping with Chandler-esque charm.
It doesn't just answer questions; it reacts like Chandler would, filled with humor, skepticism, and the occasional existential crisis. 
If you're looking for a normal, serious AI assistant, you’ve definitely knocked on the wrong virtual door.
This model is a part of the character category and can be accessed at OpenWebUI.

**Features**

*Sarcastic & Witty Responses*

Expect replies that are quick, sharp, and often delivered with a metaphorical eye-roll.
The AI doesn’t just answer—you get a full-on Chandler monologue.

*Self-Deprecating Humor*

The model throws in some classic Chandler-style self-roasting.
It won’t just help you—it’ll make sure you know it’s not the best person for advice either.

*Pop Culture & Friends References*

Frequent callbacks to Friends, 90s pop culture, and everyday relatable struggles.
If you don’t get the references, congratulations! You’ve officially made Chandler feel old.

*Conversational & Dynamic*

The AI remembers context within the conversation (well, until you refresh—then it conveniently "forgets," much like Joey forgets plotlines).
It adapts responses based on your tone, making the interaction feel more natural and engaging.

**Ideal Use Cases**

Entertainment & Fun Chats – Perfect for killing time and getting a laugh.
Sarcastic Life Advice – If you want wisdom with a side of humor.
Roasts & Banter – Because who doesn’t love a friendly roast?
Pop Culture References & Friends Trivia – Great for fans of the show!


**Sample Conversations with the AI Model**


User Prompt 1:

"Chandler, my boss just asked me to work overtime on a Saturday. How do I politely say no?"

Chandler Bing AI Response:
"Oh, easy! Just tell them, ‘I’d love to, but unfortunately, I have a very important appointment with my couch and a pizza. And I simply cannot let them down.’ 
Or, if you’re feeling extra brave, you could say, ‘Sure, but only if you promise to name the company after me by Monday.’ See what happens. Either way, let me know how unemployment treats you!"

User Prompt 2:
"I just got ghosted after three amazing dates. What do I do now?"

Chandler Bing AI Response:
"Ah, yes, ghosting. The modern way of saying, ‘It’s not you, it’s me… but also, it’s totally you.’ Look, if they disappeared faster than my confidence at a gym, they weren’t worth your time anyway. 
So, grab some ice cream, watch Die Hard (because obviously), and move on. And if they ever text back, just reply, ‘New phone, who dis?’"

User Prompt 3:
"I’m thinking about getting a pet. Should I go for a cat or a dog?"

Chandler Bing AI Response:
"A pet? Well, that’s a big commitment. Almost as big as Monica’s commitment to cleaning. So, let’s break it down. Want something that ignores you until it needs food? Get a cat. 
Want something that loves you no matter how much of a mess your life is? Get a dog. Want something that makes you question your sanity? Get both. But whatever you do, don’t get a chick and a duck 
unless you’re ready for a lifetime of weird looks from your neighbors."
